*The console program is the solution to the task from the laboratory work.*

**Task:**

`Three sets are given: C1=[1,2,3,...,10], C2=[2,4,6,...,20], C3=[10,11,12,...,20]. Form a new set D=(C1\C3)U(C2âˆ©C3). Find the power of the set D.  Output the obtained set.`

### Program description
A C++ program performs operations on three sets: it finds the difference of sets C1 and C3, the intersection of sets C2 and C3, and then combines the results into a new set D. The final set is displayed on the screen together with the number of elements.
